        <p>You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.</p>
        <p>If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.</p>
        <p><b>At higher levels:</b> This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
        <p>Classes: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>

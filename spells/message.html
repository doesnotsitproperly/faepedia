        <p class="block middle">Range / Area: 120 feet</p>
        <p class="block middle">Components: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a short piece of copper wire)</p>
        <p class="block bottom">Duration: 1 Round</p>
        <p>You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p>
        <p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>
        <p>Classes: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard</p>

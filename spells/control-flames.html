        <p class="block bottom">🔁 Transmutation cantrip</p>
        <p class="block top">Casting Time: 1 Action</p>
        <p class="block middle">Range / Area: 60 feet</p>
        <p class="block middle">Components: Somatic</p>
        <p class="block bottom">Duration: Instant</p>
        <p>You choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:</p>        
        <ul><li>You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</li><li>You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li><li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</li><li>You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li></ul>        
        <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>        
        <p>Classes: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</p>
